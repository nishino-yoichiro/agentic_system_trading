# Historical Data: Answer to Your Question

## Your Question

**"why is historical blocked if its not market hours or if there not historical data isn't the whole point to get this data?"**

## The Answer

### ✅ Historical Data is NOT Blocked

You are correct! Historical data **should** be fetchable anytime, regardless of market hours. It's data from the past that's already stored in the API.

### What Was Actually Happening

1. **Connection Error**: The adapter had incorrect parameter syntax (`feed` parameter wasn't recognized)
2. **Subscription Error**: After fixing parameters, got: `"subscription does not permit querying recent SIP data"`
3. **Empty Return**: Because of errors, `load_historical_data()` returned empty DataFrame

### The Fix

I fixed the parameter syntax. The remaining issue is:

**Alpaca subscription doesn't allow recent data queries**
- You need an Alpaca account with proper data subscription
- Or use archived/delayed data instead of recent IEX/SIP data

### The Truth About Historical Data

| Data Type | When Can Fetch | Why |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| **Historical** | ✅ Anytime (24/7) | It's data from the past, already stored |
| **Live streaming** | ⚠️ Only during market hours | No new trades when market is closed |

### Current Status

- **BTC (Coinbase)**: ✅ Historical fetches work anytime (tested and verified)
- **SPY (Alpaca)**: ⚠️ Architecture correct, but needs valid Alpaca API keys with data subscription

### Your Setup

You have:
- ✅ Coinbase API keys (working)
- ❓ Alpaca API keys (unknown if valid subscription)

### Next Steps

For SPY historical data to work:
1. Verify Alpaca API keys in `.env`
2. Confirm subscription allows recent data access
3. If not, use free delayed data (15-min delay) instead of real-time SIP data

**The adapter architecture is correct - it just needs valid API access to fetch the data.**
