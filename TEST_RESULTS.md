```

### Connection - **PASS**
```

```

## ❌ What Needs Fixing

### WebSocket Streaming - **FAIL**
```
❌ Error: year 1761619860 is out of range
❌ Timestamp conversion issue in coinbase_adapter.py
❌ Need to fix datetime parsing in stream_data()
```

**Root Cause**: The `get_candles()` method returns data in a format that needs proper timestamp conversion. Current code tries to convert Unix timestamp incorrectly.

**Fix Needed**: In `coinbase_adapter.py`, the `stream_data()` method needs to properly convert timestamps from the candle data.

## Issue Location

**File**: `src/adapters/coinbase_adapter.py`, line 142
**Problem**: `timestamp = pd.to_datetime(candle['start'])` - `candle['start']` might be a Unix timestamp or different format than expected

## Next Steps

1. Fix timestamp conversion in `stream_data()`
2. Retest WebSocket streaming
3. Test SPY (Alpaca) with same tests

## Overall Status

- ✅ Architecture: Working
- ✅ Storage: Working  
- ✅ Historical Data: Working
- ⏳ WebSocket: Needs timestamp fix
- ⏳ SPY Tests: Not run yet
