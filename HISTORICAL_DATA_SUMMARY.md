# Historical Data: Summary and Status

## Your Question

**"why is historical blocked if its not market hours or if there not historical data isn't the whole point to get this data?"**

## The Answer

### ✅ You Are Correct

Historical data **IS fetchable anytime**, regardless of market hours. This is data from the past that's already stored.

### What I Found

The error `"subscription does not permit querying recent SIP data"` means:

1. **Your Alpaca account** doesn't have permission for recent data
2. **Architectural issue**: We're requesting data that's too recent (< 15 min ago)
3. **Alpaca limitation**: Free plan has 15-minute delay for recent data

### The Fix Applied

I updated the adapter to:
- **End time = current time - 15 minutes** (for Alpaca free plan)
- **10,000 candle pagination** (respects API limit)
- **Fallback initialization** if feed parameter fails

### Current Status

| Adapter | Historical Fetch | Live Streaming | Status |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| **BTC (Coinbase)** | ✅ Works 24/7 | ✅ Works 24/7 | **COMPLETE** |
| **SPY (Alpaca)** | ⚠️ Needs valid subscription | ⏳ Needs market hours | Architecture complete |

### About Historical Data

**Crypto (Coinbase)**:
- ✅ Historical: Any time, any date range
- ✅ Live: 24/7 continuous

**Equities (Alpaca)**:
- ⚠️ Historical: Requires data subscription (free plan = 15-min delay)
- ⚠️ Live: Only during market hours (9:30-16:00 ET)

### The Bottom Line

**Architecture is correct** - both adapters can fetch historical data anytime.

**The blocker**: Alpaca API subscription doesn't allow recent data queries.

**Options**:
1. Upgrade Alpaca plan for real-time data
2. Use delayed data (15-min delay on free plan)
3. Test with older dates (before account was created?)

### Next Steps

Since we can't verify SPY historical fetch without valid subscription:
- ✅ **Architecture complete** (same pattern as BTC)
- ✅ **10,000 candle pagination** implemented
- ✅ **15-minute delay handling** implemented
- ⏳ **Needs valid Alpaca account** to test end-to-end

**For your use case**: If you want to test SPY, either:
- Get valid Alpaca API keys with data subscription
- Use archived data (pre-Oct 2025)
- Test BTC (which we know works)

Both adapters have the **same architecture and capabilities**. The SPY adapter just needs API access to actually fetch data.
